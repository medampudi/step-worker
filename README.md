[
  {
    "OutputKey": "StateMachine",
    "OutputValue": "arn:aws:states:eu-west-1:1234567890:stateMachine:step-worker-machine-stable",
    "Description": "ARN for State Machine"
  }
]

# Execute State Machine and configure BatchSize

$ > aws stepfunctions start-execution \
    --state-machine-arn arn:aws:states:eu-west-1:1234567890:stateMachine:step-worker-machine-stable \
    --input '
